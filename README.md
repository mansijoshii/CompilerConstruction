# CompilerConstruction

Here is a collection of all the codes I did in my compiler construction lab. It consists of:

1. A 2 pass Assemmbler
2. A simple lex program to count the number of words
3. A calculator using Yacc.
4. A yacc based program to check if the syntax of input C language code is correct or not.
 a) For assignment statements
 b) For if else, switch, do while
